## Opside Chain

Opside Chain is a ZK friendly modular blockchain platform with unlimited scalability.

To address the impossible triangle problem of blockchain consisting of decentralization, 
security and scalability, Opside proposes a vertically layered architecture that vertically 
divides the whole system into an asset layer, an execution layer, a Rollups layer and a data 
Opside's different layers have their own focus and are organically combined at the same time, 
thus achieving a stable triangular architecture.

Opside is inherently friendly to the ZK-Rollup off-chain scaling solution, 
natively supports interoperability between ZK-Rollups, and relies on ZK-Rollups 
to achieve unlimited scalability, which fundamentally solves the scalability problem 
while ensuring large-scale decentralization and security.
